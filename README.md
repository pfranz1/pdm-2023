# Programming Digital Media --- CSC 2463 --- Projects Repository

I took a class with Dr. Andrew Webb that teaches a number of different software frameworks. The goal is to create digital media.

We have utilzied only P5 so far. It is a javascript library to make it easy to draw graphics.

Please dont use this repository to cheat in the class. 

My hope is that these simple programming assignments will give future collaborators or employers a sense of my programming style.
